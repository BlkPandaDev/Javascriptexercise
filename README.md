# Rock Paper Scissors Game

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Rock Paper Scissors game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to play against the computer by selecting their choice of rock, paper, or scissors and displays the game results dynamically on the web page.

## Features

- The computer's choice is randomly generated for each round.
- Game results, including the computer's choice, the winner of each round, and the current scores, are displayed dynamically on the web page.
- The game keeps track of the human and computer scores, and the first player to reach a score of 6 wins the game.
- A restart button appears when either the human or computer reaches a score of 6, allowing users to restart the game.

## How to Play

2. Click on the buttons to select your choice of rock, paper, or scissors.
3. The computer's choice and the winner of each round will be displayed on the screen.
